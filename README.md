    We will be using a Global Country Information Dataset 2023 provided from Kaggle to compare the life expectancies of each country with their respective out of pocket health expenses, their forested area percentages, and their total tax rates. Our base assumptions going into this are that:
    
    -Countries with higher out of pocket health expenses are going to have a shorter life expectancy 
    -Countries with higher percentages of forested area are going to have a higher life expectancy
    -Countries with higher total tax rates are going to have a higher life expectancy
    
    We will also provide accompanying graphs for these comparisons. We will be using jupyter notebook for our extraction and transformation processes and loading them into a SQL Database.
